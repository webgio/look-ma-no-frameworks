# What is this

- This is some code put together as part of a pairing exercise with a client
- This demonstrates how I put together a JS application organically over time
- This demonstrates roughly how you would do feature folders
- This demonstrates roughly how you would detach event listeners
- This demonstrates that Knockout is cool if you limit it to specific bits of an application
- This demonstrates that you don't need a fancy framework to build an application
- This is in no way complete, it answered the questions the team had - it may not answer yours

### Rules

- Presenters must be *given* the element they own
- Presenters must implement a detach method to clean up when done
- Presenters may create other elements, and pass them to sub-presenters
- The root presenter will call detatch and that will bubble down
- A routing engine would be responsible for switching top level presenters


# Some more info

- This is backbone-ish, but without backbone. The gist being that most of the time you don't that
- WRT rendering, it does things in a few different ways across the project, this is to demonstrate options
- Obviously you'd usually render from the top level presenter to a detached fragment and then add event handlers
- If you want two-way data binding, then you do that within a presenter with whatever library and raise domain-specific events
- I'd probably not use Knockout myself, but it's there to prove a point.

# Changes I made to Rob's code

- Removed Knockout
- Used Handlebars and hbsfy instead of Mustache and brfs
- Used a dom fragment in presenters instead of direct manipulation of

# Next steps

[x] Using gruntjs to automate builds (build tests too)
[x] Adding testing with jasmine and testem

# Install
To install exec in shell:
```bash
npm install
```

# Launch app
```bash
grunt
```

# Testing
```bash
testem
```
